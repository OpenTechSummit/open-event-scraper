My Contribution: I was selected as Google Summer Code 2015 Student for KDE Org. I worked on the project LabPlot, where I integrated another application Cantor[1] into LabPlot[2]. LabPlot is a scientific data plotter application while Cantor is a front-end to powerful mathematics and statistics package. Data sources in LabPlot originate from a spreadsheet where the user types in the data by hand or import the data from an external ASCII-file to a spreadsheet. So, I integrated the worksheet capability of Cantors and extensibility to work on various back-ends such as Maxima, Octave, Python 2 and 3, R, Sage etc. to LabPlot. Now user can use those back-ends to create a worksheet inside of LabPlot and then export data from these worksheets to Plot and do a lot more with graphs than what Cantor offered before. Refer to my blog[1] for a detailed example. I have also been associated with KDE before GSOC 2015, I contributed in porting various KDE Applications to new KDE Frameworks 5 including LabPlot.
