Some think it can change cities in this century as much as electricity did in the last one. The governments of the world, the weary giants of flesh and steel, also tap into this new home.  This talk will step away from the computer screen to look at the design patterns of current toolchains for the so-called "smart city" and their implications. Is there a way the free/libre open (source software) spirit can be baked into the infrastructure that society runs on?	herr flupke  explains machines to humans and humans to machines. His work involves security and privacy, community and ethics.

Vendors taking more and more power of our devices with no return for us - the end user. They want to decide what software it runs on the hardware they sell to us. Why? Because of security. Security means to prevent the user from owning the device and gives the vendor more power to feel good. This security also restricts the usage of hardware to a certain use case. The open source world has shown there are a lot more use cases than advertised with any given hardware. The talk also gives a short overview of coreboot and how coreboot can solve some problems.	I'm an open source developer doing low level delelopment like OpenWrt and coreboot. 		
Friday March 18	2:30 PM	1/18/2016 3:23:53	Norvan	Vogt	Queensland Health		https://www.linkedin.com/in/norvanvogt						https://www.linkedin.com/in/norvanvogt		Australia	Townsville			Workshop of 1 hour	Adoption of open standards and FLOS Software in the public sector	Internet, Society, Community	Organisational budgets are shrinking and stakeholders are putting increasing pressure on public sector organisations to be efficient without jeopardising service delivery. There is a multitude of ways to share and reuse software amongst organisations and the public sector employs (and has employed) a variety of different approaches. This session will specifically focus on open source software and the factors influencing the adoption of open source software within public sector organisations. The primary objective of the session is to explore open source software benefits for public sector organisations, discuss the current state of adoption, and review the motivators and a-motivators affecting adoption. A secondary objective of the session is to investigate where organisations are utilising open source software and whether organisations consider open source software as a means of achieving business goals.	Norvan is passionate about open source technology and using ICT to make a difference in the world. At age 18, Norvan co-founded an open source software company in Canberra. In 2004, he was responsible for leading the campaign that concluded with the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) legislative assembly changing legislation, where they are preferencing open source software during procurement. Furthermore, Norvan has spent at least five years working internationally on ICT projects, creating open source solutions through community development methodologies, for the United Nations, AusAID and the World Bank, in Vanuatu, Cambodia and Guatemala.

Saturday March 19	1:30 PM	2/2/2016 15:59:09	Menghsuan	Tsai	National Cheng Kung University		https://www.facebook.com/cocotsaizax								Taiwan	Tainan			Talk of 20 minutes	How to Share Open Source	Internet, Society, Community	As a student, we want to raise the awareness of using open source software online for free. The environment of using the open source software in Taiwan is monopolized by expensive software, such as Microsoft series, Adobe and Photoshop. People seldom get a chance to realize that they actually have easy access to resources online which is free and much more convenient. Moreover, most of the budget of our country is used to buy the copyrights of software packages, but in practice we only use the basic functions of them. Simply put, we waste a lot of money buying something which is unnecessary. We discover it is the language barrier that makes people in Taiwan less likely to use open source software programs. Getting the deeper understanding of the serious problem we faced with, we come up with some solutions. Using big data to analyze vocabularies which are used frequently, we gather the information to indicate language barriers. Moreover, we can list out all the words which is hard for people, so that engineers can use the software and check the vocabularies at the same time. By using methods to remember the vocabularies, engineers can easily use the software. We can even use big data to analyze the steps which are used frequently and visualize them as a report. Like, we make a brief introduction to summarize the basic functions. So people only need to recognize the steps and check it through the introduction when they need. We launch a workshop to teach them step by step in English how to use the open source software. By enhancing engineers‚Äô English ability, now we can create a community to start influencing the general public. We create a community to overcome the language barrier and to change the habits of Taiwanese for using software. We start from NCKU and share with other schools. We create a platform for sharing the information of updated software. By translating the information from the internet like opensource.com, we provide not only the materials for target group, but also chances to the general public to know the advantages of open source software.  On the other hand, we translate the video of ‚Äúopensoucephysics‚Äù to use the materials in our education system. By using the interesting videos and materials, teachers can inspire students to think outside the box and use their imagination to understand some difficult science concepts in classes. Furthermore, we can integrate the education materials with ‚Äúezgo‚Äù and provide a chance for students to begin self-learning. We use three main methods to promote the use of open source software. First, we are going to launch a program which is composed of different schools such as NCKU, NCTU and NTU to create an engineering social media. Second, we cooperate with the professors and schools to open a course to invite students to join our translating program. Third, we create a social media and launch ‚Äúhour of translate‚Äù and invite friends to join us. Furthermore, we cooperate with the summer and winter camps to share our passion for open source software. To promote our ideas, we submit the application to teach for classes in other level of schools, such as elementary schools, junior schools and high schools.  It is necessary a waste that we seldom make the most of free resources online. We spend a lot of budget buying the software which is replaceable and deal with problems in an ineffective way. That is why we start this project to help others in an efficient way. 	I have a strong passion in dealing problems in an efficient way. No matter how much time it takes, I like to try things to benefit the society.  I am willing to devote myself to spend thousands of hours to help others save an hour for their work. I believe the environment must be changed to make it a better world for us to do things effectively. Apart from the efficiency, I am interested in joining a community because it gives me an opportunity to acquire both determination and selflessness. Working together in the community makes me feel a part of something bigger; it teaches me not to only make decision from my perspective view but to take the whole community into consideration. Although practicing coding takes sweat, I am still willing to devote myself to help others finish the projects. Not until I overcome one failure after another can I learn that the turning points are meant to trigger your potential ability. Every obstacle happened in community is a chance for me to cultivate skills and enhance competitiveness.  As the two main points mentioned above, with the ambition to challenge myself and to venture into the unknown, I would like to grab the chance to join FOSSASIA 2016. To wake myself up under the sleepy eyes of ignoring the cruel facts of the world, it‚Äôs necessary to be stimulated by the diversity. To gain more information and get to know more people, it is a great opportunity for me to face challenges and receive suggestions. I know I am still lack for experience and knowledge, so I hope, by joining FOSSASIA 2016, I can get more inspiration and innovation to make my project even better.  And...  One reason why I want to attend this program is because of my ambition for promoting the open source software. I am a sophomore at Cheng Kung University in Tainan the southern city in Taiwan. I am usually buried under a heavy load of homework during the week. So I usually try to take an adventure to try new software programs for making my work more convenient. ‚ÄúTechnology happens when imagination meets need.‚Äù With the development of the technology, I can use open sources, such as Inkscape, Amara and Gimp online. One of the most terrifying assignment that I have ever had)was assigned by Professor Yung for the course ‚Äúelectrical circuit‚Äù. We had to read through papers about the electricity and find out what we can probe from our class materials, like noise filters or common base amplifiers. Moreover, I had to make an English presentation to give my proposal in this class.  So when I finally have some free time on weekends, I can surf the internet to check out the latest information for open source. I easily use Inskape to redesign picture forms Openclipart to make eye-popping slides. Also as a English learner, I use Amara to translate video like Emma Watson‚Äôs speech in the EU from youtube. From this, I practice not only my listening skills, but also how to boost my impact of my communication in English. Simply put, I want to deliver the convince which I gain from the open source software. Open source software has changed the way I see my world, and now I want it to change the world that I see and live in.

As participants in global projects build upon each others ideas and inventions to be able to innovate in an iterative manner, a culture of co-opetition is emerging which allows companies to successfully collaborate and compete at the same time.   As part of this evolution from silo'd invention inside individual companies to collaborative project-based innovation, a parallel culture of patent non-aggression has developed through the creation of the Open Invention Network (OIN) which over the last 10 years has grown into the largest patent non-aggression community in the history of technology.     Keeping pace with the growth and proliferation of Linux and other OSS-based platforms into key markets such as mobile, home, auto and finance, OIN has doubled in size twice over the past 36 months and now is a community of over 2,000 entities and individuals explicitly committed to patent non-aggression in core technologies that enable innovation in these new markets/sectors.   The how and why of OIN's successful expansion and the benefits of participation in this free community will be discussed.	Keith Bergelt is the CEO of Open Invention Network (OIN), the largest patent non-aggression community in history, organized to support freedom of action in Linux and open source software.  OIN has more than 2,000 community members and owns more than 1,100 global patents and applications.  OIN offers a free license to its owned patents and coordinates a broad OSS-centric member cross-license; both are available in one OIN license on a royalty free basis to any party that joins the OIN community.  Prior to joining OIN, Mr. Bergelt served as CEO of two funds formed to unlock the considerable asset value of intellectual property in middle market companies.  Previously, Mr. Bergelt's private sector experience includes service as a senior advisor to the technology investment division at Texas Pacific Group.   He also headed business development, IP and licensing for Cambridge Display Technology.  Additionally, he established and served as General Manager of the Strategic Intellectual Asset Management business unit and director of Technology Strategy at Motorola.     Mr. Bergelt's public sector experience includes service as an American Diplomat in Washington, DC, New York, NY (United Nations), and Tokyo, Japan (American Embassy).

Software Patents turns out to be very difficult and vague to many of the developers. In this talk we will go through a software patent, and try to identify the key parts and the legal aspect of the same. Intellectual Property and different kinds of the same. When one can acquire different types of intellectual property rights at the same time for the different parts of the same property.  * Face of a patent (the metadata legal department cares a lot about) * Inventor, and inventorship * Can we destroy a patent? (Hint: talk to the owner) * Synopsis of the Patent * Title, abstract, and figures * The thick part (the body of the patent, or as we call it "specification") * The claims (Heart of the patent) * Indentation :) Unless and until a software patent is tested, in a court of law, by running of it, it is impossible to say if something matches with the claim of the patent or not. At the end of the talk we will go through various other resources which one can visit from where one can learn more.	Anwesha Das, an Advocate practicing law for 6 years. She is an active user of FOSS technologies. She contributes to Fedora Project.  One of her major goal is to help the FOSS developers with the legal aspect of the software industry.
