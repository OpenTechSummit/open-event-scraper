Anja Pietsch Stargarder Straße 13 10437 Berlin	Lightning Talk (5-10 minutes)	Connecting Syrian refugees	Open Hardware and Free Networks	More than 4.7 million Syrians have now fled the war and became refugees in other countries. Humanitarian aid is is usefull, but cannot replace civil rights or freedom of speech. The Berlin based independent project "Syria on the Move" gives a voice to syrian refugees and helps them to get in touch by establishing a webbased map tool. This allows refugees to upload their pictures, share experiences and comment on issues that really matter to them. 	Anja Pietsch and Jenz Steiner are two activists of the project Syria on the Move. They have been into participatory photography and grassroots media for many years.		http://socialvisions.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/syriaonthemove_logo_finale1-310x310.jpg

Instead of pointing out that the users are wrong we want to show why these »misuses« of systems make sense from the users perspective  nd why the people who use workarounds instead of the »right« tools are  hackers – without knowing it.	Jan is User Researcher, Lisa is an Anthropologist. Both are interested in why people do what they do. 		https://www.dropbox.com/s/1q40jkf6prb0dov/portrait.jpg?dl=0
