Everybody can work together – no programming skills are needed. If we want to try something new, we don't need to delete code or discuss if the library supports it: just draw and cut out the new feature!  As well we can easily do a usability test with our prototypes to get further input and check if the idea is going into the right direction. 	Jan is an UX Designer and User Researcher. His current focus is making research on user needs and motivations easier for small design teams. He contributes to open source projects like RKWard, Etherpad and quickMockup.   When not dealing with Design and Research, Jan enjoys playing guitar and reading books on neuroscience.		https://bau-ha.us/files/avatars/75/ef63f2e33acc85dc2a795fb094d7ef2f-bpfull.jpg	https://de.linkedin.com/in/jandittrich

Luckily, there is a solution: ownCloud. At the workshops we will learn how to put your data on a server of your choosing while making it available to your devices wherever you are. File sync and share with others, music, picture and video galleries, mail, calendar and contacts apps and lots of more functionality in a modular, open source and easy to use PHP server app. ownCloud offers a web interface to all its functionality as well as access through webdav, CALDAV and CARDDAV, Ampache and through the mobile and desktop clients available for Win/Mac/Linux, Android/iOS/Blackberry and more platforms.   You want it? You can have it. If you don't have a server yet, consider bringing a Raspberry Pi 2, a Banana Pi or a cubietruck with the needed tools (SD card/power/etc). Or bring a laptop, old desktop or your SSH credentials to your VPS or home server and come set up your ownCloud at the OpenTechSummit!   In this workshop you'll be walked through the process and get hands-on help in installing and getting ownCloud up and running on your system.   A quick overview of how it will (most likely) work:   First a quick 'what is ownCloud' introduction. Then everybody (probably in pairs) gets a USB stick, SD card, development board and two network cables. The USB stick has a image to be put on the SD card. Then the Pi can be booted from it, connected to the network. I monitor the network and based on the MAC of the Pi I tell you your IP. From the laptop, you SSH into the Pi and install a web server and ownCloud. From your browser you then go and configure ownCloud.	People person, technology enthusiast and all-things-open evangelist.

It is almost as easy to use as your old cassette player, if you've ever had one. Within one hour you will pick up the basics that you need in order to produce your own podcast, radio show, mixtape, listening play or wild audio collage. Please bring your own laptop, headphones, if possible: a digital audio recorder or USB-mic and all the necessary cables and cards. You may download the software and the lame codec in advance under audacity.sourceforge.net!

Its focusses lie in Modularity, Portability and Quality. During this workshop, we’ll learn how to get picoTCP running on a Cortex M3 target. The end goal of the workshop, is to play a network version of the snake game.  Target audience: Experience with C is required   What we’ll bring: * Development boards (Seeeduino Arch Pro) * USB cables * Ethernet cables for the boards * An Ethernet switch * Bootable USB sticks * Source code on a stick * Manuals for the workshop   What you should bring: * Brains ;-) * A laptop that can boot from USB or * A laptop with all the prerequisites installed (I really hope you’ll be running an Ubuntu based system, or I won’t be able to give much support) $ sudo apt-get install ncurses-base $ sudo apt-get install libncurses5-dev $ sudo apt-get -y install lib32z1 lib32ncurses5 lib32bz2-1.0 (we need some extra stuff for 64 bit) Get the cross compiler for your system (https://launchpad.net/gcc-arm-embedded/+download) Extract it in e.g. /usr/local/gcc-arm-none-eabi-4_9-2015q1/ Add compiler to your path (add export PATH="$PATH:/usr/local/gcc-arm-none-eabi-4_9-2015q1/bin/" to your ~/.bashrc file)   We’ll need python too to program the boards: sudo apt-get -y install python sudo apt-get -y install python-pip sudo pip install --pre -U pyocd   Verify installation: $ pyocd-flashtool à should tell you “waiting for a USB device connected” $ arm-none-eabi-gcc –v à should give you the nice versions	Toon is not your everyday engineer. With his passion for technology and enthusiasm for interesting projects, he can truly bring a project to the next level. All while having loads of fun.
